# ReactProject 
# SETUP

Download node.js (check the version using 'node -v' command)
Run this command to install vite version 4.1.0 (npm create vite@4.1.0) (look for a latest version if that's different than the one listed)
Set up a project name or leave by default
Select React and TypeScript when prompted on terminal
You'll asked to run these 3 commands:
  * cd react-project (or whatever project name you have selected)
  * npm install
  * npm run dev (preferrably open VS code and go to that project folder, then run this command on VS code terminal). You will be provided with a local url to run your react app
